    "__If you want your own custom-kernel to be available on any new Jupyter-workspace, please refer to the [plugin-README](https://gitlab.com/rsc-surf-nl/plugins/plugin-custom-packages/-/blob/main/README.md) or ask our [support team](https://servicedesk.surf.nl) for help.__\n",

    "Conda is the package-manager of the Anaconda ecosystem (anaconda.com).\n",

    "Miniconda is the lean standalone-installation of conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use miniconda to create virtual python environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environemts help to maintain reproducible setups for all your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ipykernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Ipykernel is a python-tool that can translate virtual environments into IPython-Kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "(IPython is the base of Jupyter notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, also the setup of your Jupyter kernels is maintainable and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying the installed custom-kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to modify any kernel in this workspace you can clone the respective conda-environemt to your home-directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to that new environment-instance.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Initialize conda\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the already installed conda-tool available for yourself, you have to initialize your terminal shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a \"Terminal\" tab in the Jupyter Lab launcher and type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "/etc/miniconda/bin/conda init\n",
    "```\n",
    "Close the terminal tab and start a new one.\n",
    "You will see that the terminal prompt has changed to something like\n",
    "```\n",
    "(base) metheuser@mywsp:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is conda telling you that you are currently in the \"base\" environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not use for your code-development, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create and activate another environment for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is outside the scope of this README but you can read up on using conda in the [conda-docs](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clone the existing environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the exact name of the environment you want to clone, execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env list\n",
    "```\n",
    "Clone this environment for yourself with\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --yes --name <your-new-environment-name> --clone <env-name-from-the-list>\n",

    "\n",
    "##### View environemnt:\n",
    "If you want to see what the currently activated environment contains, you can execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda list\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or to get a yaml file with wich you can re-create the environment elsewhere:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda export > my-exported-environment-file.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Put the file on persistent storage so it does not get lost together with your workspace!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new kernel\n",
    "If you are done with your modifications to the environment, you can create a kernel from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Make sure that the modified conda-environment is still the active one.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name <my-new-kernel-name> --display-name \"<My friendly kernel name>\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This kernel will be selectable in the Jupyter Lab launcher after a few seconds.\n"
